neural_net
==========

Rudimentary, (and not necessarily bug-free), artificial neural network implementation in C++.
Currently supports multilayered-feedforward networks with arbitrary layer sizes and connectedness,
as well as stochastic gradient descent and genetic-algorithm-based unsupervised learning.
There is not any documentation currently, really, look at the large comment blocks in the .h
files if you want to learn what things do.
